# Interpreter
This is the part of time tracking that makes sense of all of the information gathered from recorders. It's not too defined yet,
but there's a few concepts I like:

## Tags
Multiple tags can be assigned to multiple measurements. For example, `http://google.com/chrome` could be tagged with `browser`,
`productivity`, and `tool`. If the duration of a session was greater than an hour, it could be automatically labeled with `time hog`.

## Other thoughts
I may be using my phone and computer at the same time. If that's the case I shouldn't double-count the time spent. 
A set up with multiple desktops is also a tricky situation. Perhaps check how long ago they were interacted with/whether there's a media
button present/whether it's playing sound?
